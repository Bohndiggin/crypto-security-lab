Facebook in 2015 wasn't hacked as such. But it allowed scraping and misuse of data. The group that stole the data used grey-hat techniques.

While most data breaches are true ones of security. It should be noted that data is out there for many to use. Not all breaches or data leaks are 'hacks'.

The unfortunate truth is that companies spend millions to gather and index our data. It's creepy.
